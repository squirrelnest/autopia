## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the unit test runner.

### `npm test:cypress`

Launches the integration test runner.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.<br>
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

### `npm run eject`

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the create-react-app build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. This is a one-way operation that cannot be undone.

## Risks / Todos

Scalability
  - may need sass in the future if visual design choices change frequently
  - favorites are not shared across the user's other devices

Security
  - no user authentication

Accuracy
  - will need to replace placeholder formula with actual pricing formula based on mileage

Test Coverage
  - only partial coverage was given due to time constraints

UX
  - have not checked for aria compliance
  - have not checked for cross-browser compatibility

Build
  - might need to eject CRA (create-react-app) if we need custom build configuration

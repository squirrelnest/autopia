# Autopia

React web app for merchandising automobiles

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the unit test runner.

### `npm test:cypress`

Launches the integration test runner.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.<br>
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

### `npm run eject`

If you aren’t satisfied with the create-react-app build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. This is a one-way operation that cannot be undone.




## Post-Processing CSS

This project setup minifies your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) so you don’t need to worry about it.

For example, this:

```css
.App {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
}
```

becomes this:

```css
.App {
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: flex;
  -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;
  -webkit-box-direction: normal;
      -ms-flex-direction: row;
          flex-direction: row;
  -webkit-box-align: center;
      -ms-flex-align: center;
          align-items: center;
}
```

## Adding a CSS Preprocessor (Sass, Less etc.)

Generally, we recommend that you don’t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a `.Button` CSS class in `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` components, we recommend creating a `<Button>` component with its own `.Button` styles, that both `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` can render (but [not inherit](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)).

Following this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable. In this walkthrough, we will be using Sass, but you can also use Less, or another alternative.

First, let’s install the command-line interface for Sass:

```sh
npm install --save node-sass-chokidar
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add node-sass-chokidar
```

Then in `package.json`, add the following lines to `scripts`:

```diff
   "scripts": {
+    "build-css": "node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/",
+    "watch-css": "npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive",
     "start": "react-scripts start",
     "build": "react-scripts build",
     "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
```

>Note: To use a different preprocessor, replace `build-css` and `watch-css` commands according to your preprocessor’s documentation.

Now you can rename `src/App.css` to `src/App.scss` and run `npm run watch-css`. The watcher will find every Sass file in `src` subdirectories, and create a corresponding CSS file next to it, in our case overwriting `src/App.css`. Since `src/App.js` still imports `src/App.css`, the styles become a part of your application. You can now edit `src/App.scss`, and `src/App.css` will be regenerated.

To share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass imports. For example, `src/App.scss` and other component style files could include `@import "./shared.scss";` with variable definitions.

To enable importing files without using relative paths, you can add the  `--include-path` option to the command in `package.json`.

```
"build-css": "node-sass-chokidar --include-path ./src --include-path ./node_modules src/ -o src/",
"watch-css": "npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar --include-path ./src --include-path ./node_modules src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive",
```

This will allow you to do imports like

```scss
@import 'styles/_colors.scss'; // assuming a styles directory under src/
@import 'nprogress/nprogress'; // importing a css file from the nprogress node module
```

At this point you might want to remove all CSS files from the source control, and add `src/**/*.css` to your `.gitignore` file. It is generally a good practice to keep the build products outside of the source control.

As a final step, you may find it convenient to run `watch-css` automatically with `npm start`, and run `build-css` as a part of `npm run build`. You can use the `&&` operator to execute two scripts sequentially. However, there is no cross-platform way to run two scripts in parallel, so we will install a package for this:

```sh
npm install --save npm-run-all
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add npm-run-all
```

Then we can change `start` and `build` scripts to include the CSS preprocessor commands:

```diff
   "scripts": {
     "build-css": "node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/",
     "watch-css": "npm run build-css && node-sass-chokidar src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive",
-    "start": "react-scripts start",
-    "build": "react-scripts build",
+    "start-js": "react-scripts start",
+    "start": "npm-run-all -p watch-css start-js",
+    "build-js": "react-scripts build",
+    "build": "npm-run-all build-css build-js",
     "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
     "eject": "react-scripts eject"
   }
```

Now running `npm start` and `npm run build` also builds Sass files.

**Why `node-sass-chokidar`?**

`node-sass` has been reported as having the following issues:

- `node-sass --watch` has been reported to have *performance issues* in certain conditions when used in a virtual machine or with docker.

- Infinite styles compiling [#1939](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1939)

- `node-sass` has been reported as having issues with detecting new files in a directory [#1891](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/1891)

 `node-sass-chokidar` is used here as it addresses these issues.
